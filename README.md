# Procreation

A helpful utility that will assist you in creating LÃ¶ve2D executables for Windows (32-bit and 64-bit), Mac OSX, and a .love file for Linux.

## Installation

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/sqow/procreation/master/procreation -o /usr/local/bin/procreation; chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/procreation;
```

## Usage

```sh
procreation [-bh] [-t <title>] [-n <identifier>] input target
```

- It is assumed that input will be a directory that already exists. If it doesn't, this will fail.
- Target may be a directory that does not yet exist. If it doesn't, it will be created. Otherwise, it will be cleaned before use.
- Make sure your title and identifier are not null or empty strings if passed.
